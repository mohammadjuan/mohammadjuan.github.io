  <h1>About myself</h1>

  <p>Hello<br>My name is Mohammad and I am 18 years old.I am from Afghanistan.<br>
   I live with my family in Malaysia as a refugee, there are five people <br>in my family including 
   me.I have two yonger sisters and my father is a baker. On may/June 2018 I have been    graduated from a secondary school(Ideas Academy) and looking forward to join a university    to continue studying computer. I hopefully have found one but because of lack of finance, 
   I can not join.

  <h1>The reason for applying</h1>
  
  <p>When I was a kid I always like to go to cafe net and watch people doing work
  with the computer, I just go there only for watching. I used to make my own
  computer with a shoe box and play with it all the long and dream of being a
  computer man, mostly I like typing with the keyboard but as I grew up things
  changed and my view about the computer as well. I learned about coding and
  programming and my interest raised about this wonderful tool so then I
  decided to learn about programming. joining your course would be a great
  chance for me simply because I have a lack of finance to pay for the courses
  outside.</p>
